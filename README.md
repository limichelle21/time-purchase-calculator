# Time is money - have you considered the time cost of your spending habits?

I wanted to reframe how I thought about making purchases, from a Philz coffee to a new travel bag, and consider the cost in terms of time as opposed to dollars.

This calculator takes an item price and your average hourly wage to find how much an item costs in time.

Example:
*Item*: Osprey Porter 30 Travel pack - MSRP $130
*Hourly Wage*: $30
*Cost of Purchase in Time*: 4.33 hours

Would you be willing to work x-amount of time in order to make that purchase?
